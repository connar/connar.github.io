She visited the village of Santa in the North pole and she was so kind that see sent me a traditional recipe that they make there followed by an image of the village. What an amazing Aunt!\rmr Beast Xmas Giveaway\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: It was almost Christmas. You made hot chocolate to drink, sat on your comfy couch, and watched the newly uploaded Mr Beast video. Soon after, an ad appeared on your screen that led to a giveaway page seemingly run by Mr\rBeast, offering a huge Christmas prize for a few lucky winners. Filled with excitement after the video, you subscribed to the giveaway page and waited. And waited. Christmas went by, but nothing happened. Shortly afterward, you discovered an article about a phishing website, the same one you subscribed to. Confused as you read through the article, you decided to investigate the website yourself and captured its traffic. What can you find?\rMr Anderson\nDifficulty: Medium (Play/Writeup) Description: Mr. Anderson received an urgent email in July from what appeared to be his bank, notifying him of an unpaid loan in his name. Despite attempts to resolve the issue through a linked page, which continuously failed to load, Mr. Anderson received no response to his inquiries. Instead, he discovered unauthorized transactions through email notifications, sparking urgent action to secure his compromised accounts and unravel the mystery behind the email's intentions.\rWeak legacy\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: Eve was able to intercept messages between Alice and Bob, but some seem to be encrypted. Can you help her find out what they were talking about?\rInsider\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: The CTFLIB team has been constantly growing becoming like a big family. Each month new players join our team and contribute with new challenges to the server. Recently though, we had an incident. A leak of some flags to a known stolen database forum has been reported. Since there was no indication of compromise to the server, the most possible scenario is that we have an insider in our team. You, being a trusted member, are asked to investigate the latest player that joined our community to see if we rightfully suspect him of leaking the flags. We supply you with an image of his system to start your investigation.\rFlag on the run\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: A wizard was on his way to trade some secret flags with some elves and get magic filters in exchange. But one of the flags managed to escape. To make matters worse, the flag covered its tracks based on an ancient papyrus it stole from the wizard as it fled. Fortunately for him, the wizard had a copy of this papyrus and thus he can recover the flags traces. Can you help the wizard find where the flag is hidding?\rHinting flags\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: Think you can crack this users' password hint? Try analyzing this memory dump and find out for yourself.\rHeadstream\nDifficulty: Medium (Play/Writeup) Description: My friend is in love with the GTA games. Recently, the GTAVI got leaked. As soon as he read about it, he rushed to piratesbay and to his surprise, someone had uploaded the leaked version. Full of joy, he downloaded the game bu upon opening it, an error was displayed. As much as he tried fixing it, he was met with the same error. Can you help him?\rMalware Carving\nDifficulty: Medium (Play/Writeup) Description: As i was researching on the topic of virtual memory and system paging, i downloaded some pdf files to read. It was at this point where once i closed some pdf files i had finished reading with my Adobe Reader, my Antivirus notified me about some outgoing connections from my pc. Can you find what happened? Since I was reading about virtual memory, i think its better to supply you with my pagefile.sys to see what was running at the time of the incident.\rChinese Windows Upgrader\nDifficulty: Hard (Play/Writeup) Description: I wanted to upgrade my Windows to Windows 11 pro so I searched for a way to do it. I ended up finding a batch script but there is something weird about it. Since this script did not work, I opened it to see how it works but it seems like the script is written in Chinese. Can you figure out what this script does? I will provide you with the script and a memory dump of the machine to see what you can find.\rAnother malicious doc\nDifficulty: Hard (Play/Writeup) Description: Not your typical doc.\rIRS went phishing\nDifficulty: Medium (Play/Writeup) Description: I never expected the IRS to owe me money. What a lucky man I am...or am I?\rShowerpell\nDifficulty: Medium (Play/Writeup) Description: We recently had a security incident where a user installed something malicious. The analysis of the incident seems never-ending as each step reveals a new level of complexity.\rUpgrading Windows\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: I could not be more happy with the upgrade of my Windows. However, who is this new user added in the system?\rsysupdate\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: A system update you shouldn't be looking forward to.\rcaptcha 4 humans\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: Can you crack this hash and bypass the anti-human CAPTCHA?\rReverse Engineering Ancient Cave Vault\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: In the heart of a forbidding cave, an intrepid explorer ventured through the oppressive darkness, shadows dancing at the edge of her lantern's light. She stumbled upon an enigmatic ancient vault, its entrance adorned with cryptic symbols. Determined, she desperately tries to find the correct passphrase that will unlock the secrets within. But her time is running low and the beasts of the cave are starting to wake up. Can you help her?\rCryptography Sloppy Encryptor\nDifficulty: Easy (Play/Writeup) Description: I wonder if we could somehow recover the original text from the mysterious file that was found on an old hard drive of a mathematician. A script was also recovered that seems to have encrypted the text. Can you manage to recover this mysterious files?\rSigning factory\nDifficulty: Medium (Play) Description: Visit HTB for more\r",
