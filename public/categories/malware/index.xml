      <description>Intro In this post we will observe the fields a Portable Executable file (PE or also known as Image) has, how are they connected to each other and how can they be utilized to load addresses of functions, names of functions and ordinals - amongst other fields - by writing a program that reads and loads these parts of an executable. The executable we will be disassecting will be mspaint.exe.</description>

      <description>Intro As mentioned in the Exploring PEB struct and its fields post, we will now see how to to use a technique known as API Hashing. API hashing is a technique used in malware to identify API functions by their hash value from their names or other attributes. This hash value can then be used instead of the function names or other attributes to enumerate, rehash, compare and use functions based on the hash value.</description>

      <description>Intro This is the first post of the malware series that me and my friend @r4sti will be starting. We basically started learning malware concepts, dev and windows internals, and I will keep track of what we learn - like the rest of the things in this blog:)
Special thanks to him cause he is basically teaching me 70% of this stuff lol.
So in this post, we will dive into:</description>

      <title>Exploring the BatchEncryption tool (and its deobfuscator) by gwsbhqt@163.com </title>

      <description>What is the BatchEncryption tool The BatchEncryption tool is a tool used for obfuscating batch files. It is rather one of the most uncommon ones since it combines known and custom environment variable encodings to obfuscate the script. The way it works is it sets a randomly generated dictionary into a custom envar which is just a single quote (&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;). It then encodes it with existing environment variable substrings and then takes the remainder of the command using substrings of the custom environment variable declared previously.</description>

      <description>What will this post be about This post will be about the Jlaive and Get-UnJlaive tools. I will not go into depth as there are other resources I will list that do a great job explaining more in depth of the ins and outs of these tools. This will just be an overview of the tools: How to obfuscate an executable with Jlaive and how to recover it using Get-UnJlaive.</description>

      <description>Intro As I am starting to take a turn of interest into malware analysis and development, I was required to understand what the Windows API really is. So this post is basically my notes on what windows api is and a few examples of it.
Was exactly is an API When you use a Windows application, have you ever wondered how it seamlessly interacts with the operating system? The magic behind this interaction is the Windows API.</description>

      <description>Intro In this post, I will be writing my notes regarding some OneNote forensic tools that I got my hands on, but also the analysis of a sample I got from MalwareBazar to practise. The tools are:
OneNoteAnalyzer.exe pyonenote.py The sample I practised on is the following:
https://bazaar.abuse.ch/download/9019a31723e8dde778639cf5c1eb599bf250d7b6a3a92ba0e3c85b0043644d93/ Viewing the sample Opening the sample in an online .one viewer, we can observe the following:
We can see that a .cmd script is placed at the &amp;lsquo;Open&amp;rsquo; button which is what the document asks the user to double click.</description>
