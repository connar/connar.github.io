      <description>What is the Browser-in-the-Browser attack BitB attack is a phishing technique displayed by mr.d0x that essentially abuses the Single-Sign-On (SSO) window and modifies the shown url of the popped-up window to seem like a legitimate one.
Basically, the concept of this attack is to host a phishing website and inside the phishing website to create a legitimate looking SSO window (with a valid url) which is a phishing window as well.</description>

      <description>Intro In this post we are going to see how to make a phishing website to then use for other attacks such as the Browser-in-the-Browser attack ( see: BitB ).
There are plenty of tools out there to quickly set up a phishing website. For example:
Socialphish Shell Phish Zphisher Blackeye and plenty others, but also platforms like gophish.
I just happened to be reading something about Blackeye tool, so we&amp;rsquo;ll go with this option.</description>
