      <description>Intro This is the first post of the malware series that me and my friend r4sti will be starting. We basically started learning malware concepts, dev and windows internals, and I will keep track of what we learn - like the rest of the things in this blog:)
So in this post, we will dive into:
What is PEB Theory compared to a real world sample Code examples IsBeingDebugger Loaded DLLs PEB in depth - x64dbg How it can be abused (dll-unlinking) What is PEB The Process Environment Block (PEB) is a vital structure in the Windows operating system, residing in user-mode memory and accessible by the corresponding process.</description>

      <title>Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) attack</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/bitb/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/bitb/</guid>
      <description>What is the Browser-in-the-Browser attack BitB attack is a phishing technique displayed by mr.d0x that essentially abuses the Single-Sign-On (SSO) window and modifies the shown url of the popped-up window to seem like a legitimate one.
Basically, the concept of this attack is to host a phishing website and inside the phishing website to create a legitimate looking SSO window (with a valid url) which is a phishing window as well.</description>

      <title>Exploring the BatchEncryption tool (and its deobfuscator) by gwsbhqt@163.com </title>

      <description>What is the BatchEncryption tool The BatchEncryption tool is a tool used for obfuscating batch files. It is rather one of the most uncommon ones since it combines known and custom environment variable encodings to obfuscate the script. The way it works is it sets a randomly generated dictionary into a custom envar which is just a single quote (&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;). It then encodes it with existing environment variable substrings and then takes the remainder of the command using substrings of the custom environment variable declared previously.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Jlaive and UnJlaive tool</title>

      <description>What will this post be about This post will be about the Jlaive and Get-UnJlaive tools. I will not go into depth as there are other resources I will list that do a great job explaining more in depth of the ins and outs of these tools. This will just be an overview of the tools: How to obfuscate an executable with Jlaive and how to recover it using Get-UnJlaive.</description>

      <title>Exploring the pCraft tool</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pcraft/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/pcraft/</guid>
      <description>What is the pCraft tool pCraft is a tool used to generate pcaps based on a scenario written in an ami file. The generated pcap file can then be used for the testing of rules etc.
Installation To install the tool, you can either clone it from its github repo:
https://github.com/DevoInc/pCraft or by using docker.
I had some issues when running the tool from the github repo (dependency errors with the pyami module), so I went with the docker option instead, which is what I will demonstrate.</description>

      <description>Intro As I am starting to take a turn of interest into malware analysis and development, I was required to understand what the Windows API really is. So this post is basically my notes on what windows api is and a few examples of it.
Was exactly is an API When you use a Windows application, have you ever wondered how it seamlessly interacts with the operating system? The magic behind this interaction is the Windows API.</description>

      <title>Setting up a phishing site [using blackeye tool]</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/phishingsite/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/phishingsite/</guid>
      <description>Intro In this post we are going to see how to make a phishing website to then use for other attacks such as the Browser-in-the-Browser attack ( see: BitB ).
There are plenty of tools out there to quickly set up a phishing website. For example:
Socialphish Shell Phish Zphisher Blackeye and plenty others, but also platforms like gophish.
I just happened to be reading something about Blackeye tool, so we&amp;rsquo;ll go with this option.</description>
