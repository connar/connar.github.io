      <description>What is the Browser-in-the-Browser attack BitB attack is a phishing technique displayed by mr.d0x that essentially abuses the Single-Sign-On (SSO) window and modifies the shown url of the popped-up window to seem like a legitimate one.
Basically, the concept of this attack is to host a phishing website and inside the phishing website to create a legitimate looking SSO window (with a valid url) which is a phishing window as well.</description>

      <title>Exploring the pCraft tool</title>

      <description>What is the pCraft tool pCraft is a tool used to generate pcaps based on a scenario written in an ami file. The generated pcap file can then be used for the testing of rules etc.
Installation To install the tool, you can either clone it from its github repo:
https://github.com/DevoInc/pCraft or by using docker.
I had some issues when running the tool from the github repo (dependency errors with the pyami module), so I went with the docker option instead, which is what I will demonstrate.</description>

      <title>Setting up a phishing site [using blackeye tool]</title>

      <description>Intro In this post we are going to see how to make a phishing website to then use for other attacks such as the Browser-in-the-Browser attack ( see: BitB ).
There are plenty of tools out there to quickly set up a phishing website. For example:
Socialphish Shell Phish Zphisher Blackeye and plenty others, but also platforms like gophish.
I just happened to be reading something about Blackeye tool, so we&amp;rsquo;ll go with this option.</description>
