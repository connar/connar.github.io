A list of challenges (at least some of them) that I have made for either conferences, CTFs or just myself:)  
These will mostly be based on stuff I read along the way and felt like they would be fun to make and also learn by doing it.

Christmas went by, but nothing happened. Shortly afterward, you discovered an article about a phishing website, the same one you subscribed to. Confused as you read through the article, you decided to investigate the website yourself and captured its traffic. What can you find?

Each month new players join our team and contribute with new challenges to the server. Recently though, we had an incident. A leak of some flags to a known stolen database forum has been reported. Since there was no indication of compromise to the server, the most possible scenario is that we have an insider in our team. You, being a trusted member, are asked to investigate the latest player that joined our community to see if we rightfully suspect him of leaking the flags. We supply you with an image of his system to start your investigation.</small>
