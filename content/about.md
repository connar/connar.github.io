Hi! Im connar, a 22 yo learning various cybersecurity topics and playing around with different tools. Im mainly into malware stuff (analysis, development) but also into forensics. I really like making challenges (in the form of a CTF challenge) that are based on real world stuff (CVEs etc). This is basically like a journal into my journey of knowledge, keeping track of what I have learned and that may seem useful to any of you that are reading it. Obviously, my posts are things I read from other authors or youtube/other sources and just try them myself, so why not write a post about it (so all credits do not go to me lol). Last but not least, I will be creating challenges and solving them to this blog, showcasing real world scenarions. Basically, im applying Feynman Technique:P  
Hope you stick around, have fun!
