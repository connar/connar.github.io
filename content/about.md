Hi! Im connar. Im 22 and I am learning various cybersecurity topics and experimenting with different random tools I stumble upon.  
I am mainly into malware stuff (analysis and dev) but also into forensics. To be honest, I am no expert, but I am trying to apply the Feynman's technique which helps me a lot to memorize and better understand the stuff I am learning (thus, this blog).  
I also really like making CTF challenges, some of which you are going to see here in this blog:)  
This is basically a journal into my journey into cybersecurity, keeping track of what I have learned and stuff that may seem useful to any of you that are reading it. Obviously, my posts and things I read from other authors and just try to try them myself, so credits go to them:)  

That's a wrap I think. Hope you stick around, have fun:)
